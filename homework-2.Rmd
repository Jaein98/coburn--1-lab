## Linear Regression

For this lab, we will be working with a data set from the UCI (University of California, Irvine) Machine Learning repository ([see website here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone)). The full data set consists of $4,177$ observations of abalone in Tasmania. (Fun fact: [Tasmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania "Tasmania") supplies about $25\%$ of the yearly world abalone harvest.)

![*Fig 1. Inside of an abalone shell.*](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1198/8002/products/1d89434927bffb6fd1786c19c2d921fb_2000x_652a2391-5a0a-4f10-966c-f759dc08635c_1024x1024.jpg?v=1582320404){width="152"}

The age of an abalone is typically determined by cutting the shell open and counting the number of rings with a microscope. The purpose of this data set is to determine whether abalone age (**number of rings + 1.5**) can be accurately predicted using other, easier-to-obtain information about the abalone.

The full abalone data set is located in the `\data` subdirectory. Read it into *R* using `read_csv()`. Take a moment to read through the codebook (`abalone_codebook.txt`) and familiarize yourself with the variable definitions.

Make sure you load the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels`!
```{r}
install.packages("tidymodels",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(corrplot)
library(ggthemes)
set.seed(2225)
setwd("~/Downloads/homework-2")
```

### Question 1

Your goal is to predict abalone age, which is calculated as the number of rings plus 1.5. Notice there currently is no `age` variable in the data set. Add `age` to the data set.

Assess and describe the distribution of `age`.

```{r}
abalone <- read.csv(file="data/abalone.csv")
abalone %>% head()

```
```{r}
abalone["age"] <- abalone["rings"] + 1.5
ggplot(abalone, aes(x=age)) + geom_histogram(bindwidth = 1)

```



### Question 2

Split the abalone data into a training set and a testing set. Use stratified sampling. You should decide on appropriate percentages for splitting the data.

*Remember that you'll need to set a seed at the beginning of the document to reproduce your results.*

```{r}

abalone2 <- subset(abalone, select = -rings)
abalone_split <- initial_split(abalone2, prop = 0.80,
                                strata = age)
abalone_train <- training(abalone_split)
abalone_test <- testing(abalone_split)

```



### Question 3

Using the **training** data, create a recipe predicting the outcome variable, `age`, with all other predictor variables. Note that you should not include `rings` to predict `age`. Explain why you shouldn't use `rings` to predict `age`.

/*you should not use rings in order to predict age because age is equal to rings + 1.5, so it has correlation between them*/

Steps for your recipe:

1.  dummy code any categorical predictors
```{r}
abalone_recipe <- recipe(age ~ ., data = abalone_train) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())



```
2.  create interactions between

    -   `type` and `shucked_weight`,
    -   `longest_shell` and `diameter`,
    -   `shucked_weight` and `shell_weight`

3.  center all predictors, and

4.  scale all predictors.

You'll need to investigate the `tidymodels` documentation to find the appropriate step functions to use.
```{r}
abalone_mod <- abalone_recipe %>%
  step_interact(terms = ~ starts_with("type"):shucked_weight + longest_shell:diameter + shucked_weight:shell_weight) %>%
  step_center(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_scale(all_predictors())
  


abalone_mod




```









### Question 4

Create and store a linear regression object using the `"lm"` engine.

```{r}

lm_model <- linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lm")


lm_model




```









### Question 5

Now:

1.  set up an empty workflow,
2.  add the model you created in Question 4, and
3.  add the recipe that you created in Question 3.
```{r}
  lm_wflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(lm_model) %>% 
  add_recipe(abalone_mod)

lm_wflow

```

### Question 6

Use your `fit()` object to predict the age of a hypothetical female abalone with longest_shell = 0.50, diameter = 0.10, height = 0.30, whole_weight = 4, shucked_weight = 1, viscera_weight = 2, shell_weight = 1.
```{r}
lm_fit <- fit(lm_wflow, abalone_train)
female_age <- data.frame(longest_shell = 0.50, diameter = 0.10, height = 0.30, whole_weight = 4, shucked_weight = 1, viscera_weight = 2, shell_weight = 1, type='F')

predict(lm_fit, female_age)
```

### Question 7

Now you want to assess your model's performance. To do this, use the `yardstick` package:

1.  Create a metric set that includes *R^2^*, RMSE (root mean squared error), and MAE (mean absolute error).
2.  Use `predict()` and `bind_cols()` to create a tibble of your model's predicted values from the **training data** along with the actual observed ages (these are needed to assess your model's performance).
3.  Finally, apply your metric set to the tibble, report the results, and interpret the *R^2^* value.

```{r}

abalone_train_res <- predict(lm_fit, new_data = abalone_train %>% select(-age))
abalone_train_res <- bind_cols(abalone_train_res, abalone_train %>% select(age))
rmse(abalone_train_res, truth = age, estimate = .pred)
abalone_metrics <- metric_set(rmse, rsq, mae)
abalone_metrics(abalone_train_res, truth = age, 
                estimate = .pred)





```
